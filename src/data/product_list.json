				"question": "Is it necessary to upgrade to the Mavic 3 Pro Series if I already have a Mavic 3 or Mavic 3 Classic?",
				"answer": "Compared with Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Classic, we've significantly upgraded the imaging performance of the Mavic 3 Pro Series.\nThe Mavic 3 Pro Series includes DJI's first tri-camera flagship drones with multiple focal lengths. It uses the same wide-angle 4/3 CMOS Hasselblad camera as Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Classic. Compared with Mavic 3, it adds a 1/1.3-inch CMOS 70mm medium tele camera with 48MP effective pixels. It also has an upgraded 1/2-inch CMOS 166mm tele camera with 12MP effective pixels, providing more flexible aerial photography perspectives while enhancing creative efficiency and freedom.\nAll three cameras of the Mavic 3 Pro Series drones support shooting 4K/60fps video, and all three cameras of the Cine version support Apple ProRes 422/422 HQ/422 LT codecs. No matter which version you choose, you will enjoy high-level professional creation.\nIf you need more focal length options, better creative effects, and work that has more expressive composition and storytelling details, the Mavic 3 Pro Series is here to meet your shooting needs.\nIn addition, the Mavic 3 Pro Series also supports the Hasselblad Natural Colour Solution (HNCS), D-Log, D-Log M, HLG, and other color modes, which retain more image details and facilitate more efficient color grading in post-production."
			},
			{
				"question": "What are some use cases for the new 70mm medium tele camera of the Mavic 3 Pro Series?",
				"answer": "The 70mm medium tele camera is equipped with a 1/1.3″ CMOS sensor. Compared with the wide-angle Hasselblad camera, the 70mm medium tele camera captures footage with a stronger sense of spatial compression, which can better capture the relationship between the subject and the surroundings, highlight the subject in a complex environment, and create a visual focus in the image or video. Additionally, the medium tele camera supports Night video mode (Night Shots), presenting brilliant nighttime scenes at a 70mm focal length.\nCompared with the 166mm tele camera, using the medium tele camera may be better in some scenarios. It enables new aerial photography perspectives and can help to achieve different camera movements. You don't need to replace the camera on the drone during shooting. Just tap the screen to switch between different focal lengths, making transitions smoother and more natural.\nThe medium tele camera supports a 3x optical zoom and the new D-Log M color mode, further reducing the difficulty of color grading in post-production. It also supports FocusTrack, Hyperlapse, and 3x-7x digital zoom to help you create cinematic footage effortlessly."
			},
			{
				"question": "What are the advantages of the 166mm tele camera?",
				"answer": "The upgraded tele camera features higher resolution and a wider f/3.4 aperture. It supports shooting 4K/60fps video with 7x optical zoom and 12MP photos. The hybrid zoom reaches up to 28x. Zoom in and immerse your image in rich details. The tele camera also supports HLG and 10-bit D-Log M color modes, enabling greater flexibility in post-production."
			},
			{
				"question": "What differentiates Mavic 3 Pro Cine from Mavic 3 Pro? How should I choose?",
				"answer": "The Mavic 3 Pro Series includes two versions: Mavic 3 Pro and Mavic 3 Pro Cine.\nMavic 3 Pro inherits DJI's flagship imaging and flight performance. It is portable, powerful, and suitable for photography enthusiasts, professional photographers, and film/television studios.\nMavic 3 Pro Cine boasts a built-in 1TB SSD and supports professional video encoding like Apple ProRes 422, Apple ProRes 422 HQ, and Apple ProRes 422 LT. It is a perfect choice for professional film/television production."
			},
			{
				"question": "What are the differences between DJI RC and DJI RC Pro? How should I choose?",
				"answer": "Both remote controllers come with a 5.5-inch HD screen, so you can power on and use them directly without the need to connect to a mobile device.\nDJI RC Pro features a screen brightness of up to 1000 nits and supports the installation of third-party apps and the live stream function, allowing you to live stream the real-time camera view during flight.\nDJI RC Pro is equipped with the latest-generation processor, offering stronger performance and lower power consumption. This results in 4x improved CPU performance, 7x improved GPU performance, and 20% lower power consumption over its predecessor. DJI RC Pro brings a more durable, stable, and smooth system that simply enhances flying."

				"question": "What are the advantages of the 1-inch sensor camera on DJI Air 2S?",
				"answer": "DJI Air 2S features a 1-inch CMOS sensor, offering exceptional exposure sensitivity and dynamic range. A bigger sensor means the camera can collect more visual information, resulting in images and footage with stunningly rich detail. DJI Air 2S can also capture up to 12.6 stops in RAW, providing more details on highlights and shadows. This also allows more room for editing in post. A big sensor usually means a larger, heavier drone, but not with DJI Air 2S. DJI Air 2S still weighs less than 600g, making it the ideal choice for aerial photography on the go."

				"question": "What’s the difference between DJI FPV and traditional drones?",
				"answer": "Generally speaking, FPV drones differ from traditional drones in two major ways. The first is the immersive flight experience provided by the goggles. The second big difference is the flight itself. Compared to most camera drones, FPV drones typically allow for much higher speeds and limitless maneuvering capabilities with no angle limits on any of the axes. Because of this, FPV drones have typically required a much higher level of skill to fly."

				"question": "Do I need to assemble the DJI FPV drone myself?",
				"answer": "No. Like many previous DJI drones, DJI FPV doesn’t require any assembly. Simply open the box, install the propellers and battery, and DJI FPV is ready to fly. However, DJI FPV does have a modular design with easily replaceable parts. Users can replace the top cover, gimbal camera, and landing gear if any of these parts become damaged."

				"question": "Can I use DJI Inspire 3 with the X9 gimbal camera, TB50 battery, and storage card of DJI Ronin 4D interchangeably?",
				"answer": "The gimbal camera and TB50 battery are not interchangeable. The storage card is interchangeable.\n\nTo improve DJI Inspire 3’s battery life, flight experience, and performance and stability at all attitudes and speeds, Inspire 3’s X9-8K Air gimbal camera has been optimized specially for aerial photography. Compared with the X9-6K and X9-8K gimbal cameras of Ronin 4D, the X9-8K Air’s weight is reduced by approximately 50% with a centralized center of gravity, ensuring an improved flight time and flight experience. Additionally, the gimbal axis arms and lens locking design adopt optimized vibration-proof designs for aerial photography so that the aircraft can stay stable even during dramatic or high-speed flight maneuvers.\n\nThe new TB51 battery features higher energy density with reduced weight, and size, which is beneficial for the total flight time and wind resistance when flying forward, and is more advantageous than TB50 in terms of discharge voltage and reliability.\n\nThe DJI PROSSD 1TB of DJI Ronin 4D is interchangeable with Inspire 3."

			{
				"question": "Does DJI Inspire 3 support using dual remote controllers at the same time?",
				"answer": "Yes. In the new dual-control mode, two remote controllers can receive live feeds and control the drone independently, so the pilot and gimbal operator can be at different positions on set during flight. Check the DJI Inspire 3 User Manual for more details."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do I achieve the largest tilt and pan angles with the DJI Inspire 3 gimbal camera?",
				"answer": "When the landing gear of DJI Inspire 3 is raised, it supports 360° pan shooting obstruction-free. When the landing gear is lowered and the gimbal camera faces forward, it can achieve 80° tilt shooting obstruction-free."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I take DJI Inspire 3’s batteries in carry-on baggage when boarding an airplane?",
				"answer": "Yes. The capacity of a DJI Inspire 3 Intelligent Battery is 4280 mAh and the energy is 98.8 Wh. Most aviation companies regulate that batteries under 100 Wh can be transported in carry-on baggage."
			},
			{
				"question": "Does DJI Inspire 3 support the DJI High-Bright Remote Monitor?",
				"answer": "Yes. DJI High-Bright Remote Monitor can pair directly with Inspire 3 to receive live feeds, and can even control gimbal and focus when the Ronin 4D Hand Grips are attached. HDMI and SDI ports on the remote monitor can also output live feeds to other monitoring devices."
